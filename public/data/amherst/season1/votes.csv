Okay I just listened to all six. This one is definitely the most hype.

No. It's a theme song from a 1986 movie (with 92% on Rotten Tomatoes, respect) about a small-town Indiana high school basketball team led by Gene Hackman.

This is a rap song. It has a rapper DUO. The prompt says NON-RAP SONG

I looked it up and it's actually ""Hip-hop, neo soul and R&B,"" not rap, so you're in the clear. But man is it close. Can't disagree with the wikipedia definitions

This brings up an important issue that so far, thankfully, has not been relevant: What is the punishment for prompt violators, prompt perpetrators? Death? Worse?

I'm trying to figure out what exactly this reminds me of. Kinda Slint / The Breeders / Daydream Nation-era Sonic Youth (which to be fair is the only era of Sonic Youth I am even a little familiar with). It's very late 80s / early 90s alt-rock.

I've been following this band called Speedial from Australia that sounds similar to this but with more horns.",1117f97da7ad4cc48b8f89f7f07c1ab0

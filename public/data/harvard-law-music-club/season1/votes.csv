It slaps, hits, insert whatever other word of violence indicates quality. However, it pains me to point out that it absolutely does not have a run time under 2 minutes. In fact it has a runtime of 2:01 so there isn't even the argument that it's ambiguous whether exactly 2 minute songs are within the prompt. Now it's possible that democracy and the greatness of this song will outweigh the fact that it's off by one second but those votes won't come from me. ",c3c3872df1ea4c358737f06654c76b07

Someone ruined them for me a bit when they said they couldn't really tell the difference between any vampire weekend song.

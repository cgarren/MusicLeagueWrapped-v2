I'm still not going to vote for it. I think fundamentally when you have a song with another artist that is huge it undercuts your ability to be a one hit wonder. The wonder of the one hit is how you didn't do well in the future. Here we have no idea what was contributed by who so maybe they just sucked. ,dd848eab295e4757881e2b2eaecbbdbc

Crazy that two of the submissions this week have ""Song <number>"" in the title indicating that they're probably a little different. This one is really cool and I like the rock-y/weird style.

I understand that it's less clubby and a little more mainstream than her popular stuff but I have to draw the line somewhere.

I considered submitting her for the under 2 min round but I think she works here just as well. Thanks for showing this to me- the rest of the EP is fire too.

Regardless, yes I did take this song from How I Met Your Mother and it's damn good and so are many songs by the New Pornographers even if I haven't listened to much of his other solo work.

In short, Rihanna's part is a cover of a 1959 song by Bobby Bland (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8stN0eGVAk)

The Bobby Bland song became a blues classic, covered by many, including a cover by poet/jazz legend Gil Scott Heron, which appeared on his final album in 2010 before he died in 2011 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXPN2dbgu5g)

In 2011, British artist Jamie XX did a remix of the Gil Scott Heron cover (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaXslpx3MWY)

Finally, Drake sampled the Jamie XX beat and got Rhianna to cover the Gil Scott Heron cover of Bobby Bland. And that's how we got Take Care.

Some say that Gil Scott invented rap, but Bobby's song even predates his career. Like all great pop songs, Take Care has a tapestry of timeless influences.

How it works:
• Calculate total votes received ÷ number of submissions for each competitor
• Only competitors with 3+ submissions are considered
• The competitor with the highest average wins
• Though similar to most popular overall, this rewards consistency over volume and accounts for competitors who submit less songs for whatever reason`,

	mostAverage: `This award goes to the competitor whose average score is closest to the overall league average, representing the most "typical" performer.

How it works:
• Calculate each competitor's average votes per submission
• Calculate the overall league average across all competitors

	comebackKid: `This award goes to the competitor who made the biggest comeback from their lowest-scoring submission to their best subsequent performance.

How it works:
• For each competitor, find their lowest-scoring submission
• Look for their highest-scoring submission that came after that low point
• Calculate the difference (comeback magnitude)
• Must be at least 5 points improvement to qualify
• The competitor with the biggest comeback wins`,

	trendSetter: `This award recognizes the competitor who submitted the most obscure songs based on Spotify popularity scores.

How it works:
• Each song has a Spotify popularity score (0-100, where lower = more obscure)

• The competitor with the lowest average popularity wins`,

	mainstream: `This award goes to the competitor who submitted the most popular songs based on Spotify popularity scores.

How it works:

	mostCompatible: `This award goes to the pair of competitors who consistently gave each other the highest votes.

How it works:
• Calculate average points each competitor gave to the other's submissions
• Compatibility score = geometric mean of both averages (e.g., √(3 × 4) = 3.46)
• Score ranges from 0-5+ where higher = more mutually supportive voting
• Only pairs where both have 3+ submissions are considered
• The pair with the highest compatibility score wins`,

	leastCompatible: `This award goes to the pair of competitors who consistently gave each other the lowest votes.

	longestComment: `This award goes to the competitor who left the single longest comment when voting.
